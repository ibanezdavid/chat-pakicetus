# chat-pakicetus
In this project, I have configured my notebook as a server through which it is possible to chat. I have configured the public IP of my home router, so that any connection is directed to my notebook through port 9999. In this way, through the use of sockets and graphical interfaces in Java, we can have a fully functional chat.
