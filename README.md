# chat-pakicetus
In this project, I have set up my notebook as a server through which it is possible to chat. I have configured the public IP of my home router, so that any connection is directed to my notebook through a specific port. In this way, through the use of sockets and graphical interfaces in Java, we can have a fully functional chat between different clients connected from different locations.
